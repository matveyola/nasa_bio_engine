The principal species for biomedical research in this project was the mouse. This paper presents an overview of the scientific goals, the experimental design and the mouse training/selection program. The aim of mice experiments in the Bion-M 1 project was to elucidate cellular and molecular mechanisms, underlying the adaptation of key physiological systems to long-term exposure in microgravity. The studies with mice combined INTRODUCTION: After a 16-year hiatus, Russia resumed in 2013 its program of biomedical research in space, with the successful 30-day flight of the Bion-M 1 biosatellite (April 19–May 19, 2013), a specially designed automated spacecraft dedicated to life-science experiments. “M” in the mission's name stands for “modernized”; the epithet was equally applicable to the spacecraft and the research program. The principal animal species for physiological studies in this mission was the mouse ( Mus musculus ). Unlike more recent space experiments that used female mice, males were flown in the Bion-M 1 mission. The challenging task of supporting mice in space for this unmanned, automated, 30-day-long mission, was made even more so by the requirement to house the males in groups. Russian biomedical research in space traditionally has employed dogs, rats, monkeys, and more recently Mongolian gerbils. The flight of Laika in 1957 was one of the early dog experiments and became world famous for demonstrating that a living organism can withstand rocket launch and weightlessness, thus paving the way for the first human spaceflight. Laika's success also promoted biomedical research with other non-human animals in space that culminated with the Bion biosatellites program. A total of 212 rats and 12 monkeys were launched on 11 satellites and exposed in microgravity for 5.0–22.5 days between 1973 and 1997. Animal experiments on the Bion missions have contributed comprehensive data on adaptive responses of sensorimotor, cardiovascular, muscle, bone and other systems to spaceflight conditions and the mechanisms underlying these adaptations [1] , [2] . The use of mice for space experiments offers numerous advantages. Probably the most apparent one is their small size and thus the possibility of utilizing more animals per flight, thus increasing scientific output and the cost-efficiency ratio. Comparisons of data obtained with mice, with those obtained from larger species or humans can also reveal how factors affecting adaptation to spaceflight conditions depend on the size of the organism. The mouse has become the most prevalent “mammalian model” in biomedical research, with a fully described genome and an established role in genetically engineered mutants. While mice are preferred mammalian models for molecular biology studies, their small size is a debated limitation rather than an advantage for physiological studies. Miniaturization of scientific hardware has reduced some of the disadvantages of the species small size. Finally, the use of genetically controlled mice offers a means to reduce inter-individual variability and obtain potentially more consistent results. Despite the advantages of the mouse as a model organism for space research, their use was rather limited (apart from a number of experiments with mice during early space exploration in the 1950's and 1960's, which were aimed primarily at testing if living organisms can survive the launch or a brief exposure in microgravity) [3] . Flight experiments with mice were performed aboard STS-90 (“NeuroLab”), STS-108, STS-129, STS-131 (“Mouse Immunology I”), STS-133 (“Mouse Immunology II”), and STS-135 with exposure times ranging from 12 to 16 days. Research programs of these flights were largely focused on studies of muscle, bone/tendon/cartilage, nervous, and cardiovascular systems, and innate and acquired immune responses. Experiments were performed with groups of 30 or fewer female C57BL/6J mice, which were dissected typically shortly after return [4] – [9] . The Mice Drawer System (MDS) experiment of the Italian Space Agency is by far the longest spaceflight of mice to date [10] . In this mission, 6 mice were exposed for 91 days aboard the International Space Station. The advantages offered by the possibility of genetic manipulations with mice were utilized in this experiment; three mice were transgenic with pleiotrophin overexpression (C57BLJ10/ PTN) and three mice were their wild-type counterparts. The MDS habitats required periodic replenishment and servicing by by astronauts. Sadly, half of the mice died during the course of this mission due to various estimated reasons. In the present paper we aim to present a brief overview of the Bion-M 1 mission scientific goals and experimental design. Of particular interest we will focus on the program of mouse training and selection for the experiments, and some outcomes of the Bion-M 1 mission. The scientific program of the Bion-M 1 project was aimed at obtaining data on mechanisms of adaptation of muscle, bone, cardiovascular, sensorimotor and nervous systems to prolonged exposure in microgravity and during post-flight recovery. To this aim, functional measurements in vivo were combined with complementary morphological, biochemical, cellular and molecular studies performed in vitro . To our knowledge, Bion-M 1 is the first study with mice to follow the dynamics of re-adaptation to normal gravity or to assess post-flight in vivo functions. The in vivo measurements in-flight included video recording of mice behavior and continuous recording of arterial pressure during all stages of the flight. After the flight, testing of animal behavior, memory and learning, vestibular function, physical activity, strength and fitness, as well as continuous registration of cardiovascular parameters were performed. The set of in vivo measurements was designed to provide data on the effects of microgravity on the physiological systems of interest, and to follow the time course of re-adaptation to Earth's gravity after the flight. To reduce the possibility of inadvertently stressing the mice with numerous post-flight tests and thus obscuring the effects of spaceflight, the decision was made to monitor mice in their home cage using an automated data collection system (TSE PhenoMaster) and implantable telemetry, while reducing the number of tests [11] . The program had to be performed with a limited number of animals; thus the use of a repeated measures design. Mice were tested before and after the flight (or its simulation on-ground) [12] . The in vitro studies were focused on metabolism and the structure and function of tissues from microgravity-exposed mice. More specifically, the individual studies were selected to maximize the scientific yield and targeted the impact of microgravity and other factors specific to spaceflight on biochemical, morphological and, primarily, cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the adaptation of main physiological systems, such as the central nervous system, sensory systems, skeletal muscle, supporting tissues, including bone and connective tissues, cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive, neuroendocrine and immune systems. The following organs and tissues were harvested: brain structures, vestibular organs, retina and crystalline lens, spinal cord, muscles of hind limbs and back, vertebral column, fore and hind paw bones, articular and cartilage structures, ligaments, bone marrow, cardiac muscle, arteries from brain and hind legs, lung, intestines, liver, kidney, spleen, thymus, skin, salivary glands, testis and blood. These samples were analyzed using morphological (light and electron microscopy, histochemistry and immunohistochemistry), biochemical and a variety of molecular-biology techniques (enzyme-linked immune assays, high-pressure liquid chromatography, western-blot, real-time PCR, whole-genome gene expression). Functional properties of skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle and resistive arteries samples were evaluated using myography and atomic force microscopy. Mice for in vitro studies were euthanized by cervical dislocation; because of the diversity and number of studies, this method was chosen as the common procedure to reduce variability and one that provided the least interference with the objectives of the in vitro studies.

Functional properties of skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle and resistive arteries samples were evaluated using myography and atomic force microscopy. Mice for in vitro studies were euthanized by cervical dislocation; because of the diversity and number of studies, this method was chosen as the common procedure to reduce variability and one that provided the least interference with the objectives of the in vitro studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was approved by IACUC of MSU Institute of Mitoengineering (Protocol № 35, 1 November, 2012) and of Biomedical Ethics Commission of IBMP (protocol № 319, 4 April, 2013) and conducted in compliance with the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes [13] . Experiments were performed with C57BL/6N male mice. The choice of strain was based on the requirements of the tissue harvesting program participants and the fact that C57/BL6 is one of the most widely used strains. The selection of male mice was based on the same requirement. The advantages offered by using males are their substantially larger size and the absence of sex steroid cycling compared to females; the vast majority of animal research is conducted using males, so their use in this study made the results more readily comparable to the data in the published literature. Nevertheless, the risks associated with group-housing mature males were recognized and greatly affected the preparatory procedures. It was decided that the optimal age of mice at launch was 4–5 months, when the males were still young but fully mature. The growth rate in mice is known to slow down by this age, and obesity, which C57/BL6 mice are prone to exhibit, is not yet considered a factor. Space environment affects microorganisms by increasing their virulence; major shifts in immune status in space are well documented [5] , [8] . It is reasonable to think that even pseudo pathogenic species may increase morbidity during prolonged exposure in space [14] , [15] . These considerations underscored the necessity for the use of specific pathogen-free mice in the experiments, a side benefit of this approach being the reduced variability of data obtained in SPF-animals [16] . Male C57BL/6N mice (n = 300) weighing 22–25 g were purchased from the Animal Breeding Facility - Branch of Shemyakin & Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry. Mice were specific pathogen free. The main site for mouse training was the animal facility of Moscow State University's Institute of Mitoengineering. At the time of launch and the start of the related control experiments, the mice were 19–20 weeks old. Mice were individually identified using RFID chips (El1000, Felixcan, Spain) and earmarks. Routine manipulations of the mice consisted of daily handling, examination, and weighing. The Bion-M 1 biosatellite, launched on April 19, 2013 from cosmodrome Baikonur, and the descent module landed on May 19, 2013 in the vicinity of Orenburg, successfully fulfilling the plan for an unmanned, 30-day-long orbital spaceflight. Housing and climate parameters were replicated in the subsequent ground control (GC) experiment (July 26 to August 26, 2013). A total of 4 experimental groups were used for the flight and ground control experiments (n = 45 per group). An additional fifth group included the backup mice for the main flight group (n = 45). Mice of the space flight group (SF) were exposed to microgravity for 30 days. Concurrent with the SF mice, another group of 45 mice remained in the animal facility (SFV). The ground control (GC) experiment was conducted, after the landing, in the refurbished BOS flight habitats. The habitats were installed in a climatic chamber that replicated the temperature, humidity, gas composition and other flight-specific climate parameters. The corresponding vivarium control (GCV) mice were housed in the animal facility. The separate and concurrent GCV groups were used to account for possible seasonal differences between SF and GC mice. Each of the groups (SF, GC, SFV, GCV and backup SF mice) included mice designated for in vivo studies and recovery (n = 10) and mice for dissection and in vitro measurements (n = 35). Each in vivo study subgroup, in its turn, consisted of 5 mice implanted with telemetry probes to monitor blood pressure and 5 intact animals. Mice were handled and trained before the flight and ground control experiments. Basically, training consisted of shaping the groups of three mice each for social housing and adaptation to paste diet. The training of mice designated for in vivo studies was more comprehensive. It started with implanting the telemetry probes and, following recovery, a set of preliminary behavioral and functional tests ( Figure 1 , Table 1 and 2 ). Mice of SF, SFV and backup SF groups were co-adapted in housing groups of 3 mice each, SF mice were adapted to paste food diet, and mice of in vivo subgroups passed through preliminary tests. After transportation to and adaptation at Baikonur, SF mice were flown aboard the Bion-M 1 satellite for 30 days. After landing mice were examined and transported to Moscow, where animals of the in vitro subgroup were dissected, while recovery dynamics was followed in the in-vivo subgroup before dissection 7 days after landing. Ground control experiment replicated the principal stages of the spaceflight experiment. The BOS habitats were designed to house up to three mice per group [17] . Stable cohorts of three mice were maintained throughout the training program and consequent experiments, with the exception of brief periods of post-surgery recovery (5–6 days) and behavioral tests (7 days), when they were housed individually. Individually ventilated cages (GM 500, Techniplast, floor area 500 cm 2 ) were used. Techniplast mice shelters (red plastic triangles, 15Lx11Wx8H cm), paper tubes and paper tissues for nesting material were provided to enrich the environment. Cage cleaning was done once weekly, and water was refreshed twice weekly. All materials were sterilized prior to use by autoclave. Techniques aimed to prevent animal contamination were thoroughly followed. The hardware for mice housing in-flight was an adapted version of the habitats used for rats in the original Bion program. It was developed by Biofizpribor, according to the IBMP requirements and was tested by IBMP in 2011. Each block consisted of five individual habitats (BOS, Block Obespecheniya Soderzhaniya, Russian for - literally - Unit for the Provision of Housing). The living compartment of each habitat was an acrylic cylinder 98±2 mm in diameter and 200±10 mm in length with a total volume of approximately 1.7 l ( Figure 2 ). A stainless steel feeder (9 ml) was mounted at one end (the “top”) of the cylinder. The feeder had a flap, used in the refill procedure. The food distribution system (except for the feeders) was common to all five habitats in the block. Paste “space” food was pumped from the container and distributed between individual habitats of the assembly 6 times daily (every 4 hours at 00:00, 04:00, 08:00, 12:00, 16:00 and 20:00), a total of 54 g/day per 3 mice. Food distribution was adjusted through manipulations of pressure developed in the container and in the feeders to follow this pattern prior to experiments. Bulbs for day-phase (08:00–20:00, 45±5 Lux) and night-phase (20:00–08:00, 5±2 Lux) lighting, an air supply fan (0.3 m/s) and an air distribution system were positioned on one side of the cylinder. A video camera was installed between the light bulbs; video was recorded 6 times daily (simultaneously with feeding, each session lasted 2 hours) at 8 frames per second. The opposite side of the cylinder had the grid for waste removal. The waste removal system was individual for each habitat. The door at the “bottom” of the cylinder had a glass window. In order to minimize impact of variability arising from possible differences in mice housing conditions, experimental subgroups were formed from mice that were housed in different habitats. Air composition and climate parameters in the satellite were maintained by the centralized life support system and remained in the designed range throughout the flight. During the initial stage of training, mice were provided with standard pelleted food (Assortiment Agro, Russia) and deionized water given ad libitum . Two weeks prior to launch, and the start of the GC experiment, the animals were adapted to the flight paste food diet. Both the paste and standard diets (pelleted food and water) were first presented together; after 2–3 days the water bottle was removed, followed in another 2–3 days by the removal of the pelleted food. Vivarium control (SFV and GCV) groups were fed standard chow and water throughout the experiments. The “space” paste food diet was developed at IBMP by T. Gurieva and E. Mednikova. It was produced based on the standard chow, with water and casein as gelling agent added. Consumption of standard pelleted chow and water (in SFV and GCV) or paste diet (in SF and GC) was monitored daily for ten days in ten randomly chosen cages per group. Data for the cage was averaged across the days and expressed as g per 10 g bodyweight. A separate preliminary experiment in metabolic chambers was conducted to quantify urination in mice fed standard chow and paste food. Four groups of mice, of 3 mice each, were housed in metabolic chambers (Techniplast, Italy) and fed pelleted food (grinded) or paste food. Body weight, food and water consumption, urine volume and feces weight were monitored daily (3 days for each diet). Arterial pressure was monitored in sub-groups of mice designated for recovery, using implantable probes and telemetry hardware (Data Science International, USA). The hardware was adapted and integrated to the Bion-M biosatellite by engineers from Biofizpribor (St. Petersburg, Russia) and the Centre national d'études spatiales (CNES, France). Miniature probes (model PA-C10) weighing 1.4 g were implanted 3 weeks before the start of experiments, following the manufacturer's instructions. The catheter of the probe was implanted into the left carotid so that its tip just reached the aorta [18] . The body of the transmitter was implanted subcutaneously on the flank, briefly described below. Mice were anaesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of a solution containing tiletamine/zolazepam (15 mg/kg each) combined with xylazine (3 mg/kg). Depth of anesthesia was assessed regularly by hind leg pinch and observation of respiration rate, and maintained by additional dose(s) of the mixture (about 20% of the initial dose) as needed. A midline incision was made on the ventral neck. The carotid artery was separated and ligated 1–2 mm cranially to its bifurcation. A second ligature was used to suspend the artery 4–5 mm proximal to the site of ligation. Through a small incision in the artery wall, the catheter was advanced 6–7 mm towards the aorta and fixed in place with sutures and acrylic glue. A subcutaneous pocket on the flank of the animal was made with blunt scissors, and the transmitter was inserted there with a small hemostat. The catheter and the transmitter were fixed in place with acrylic glue and the skin incision closed with absorbable sutures. During the recovery period, mice were housed individually; they were under daily veterinarian control and received ibuprofen 4 mg/ml and Bactrim 4 mg/ml in drinking water. Mice for the in vivo studies were trained and tested before the experiments to select homogenous groups and to benefit from repeated measures in experimental design; the latter consideration was particularly important in light of relatively small number of animals. On the morning of day 0 mice a battery of behavioral and functional tests was administered. First, animals were examined for visible abnormalities in exterior and simple reflexes [19] . The Open field test was performed in a round, 60 cm arena of black plastic with a grey floor and 40 cm high walls [20] . Mouse behavior was video recorded at 25 fps for 10 minutes under a bright white light (200 Lux) followed by 10 min in darkness (IR light). Videos were analyzed for locomotor activity and other behavioral parameters using EthoVision v. 8.5 (Noldus). Grip force was measured using Grass FT-03 force transducer [21] . Analog output was amplified, digitized at 1 kHz sampling rate and analyzed using PowerGraph software (InteropticaS, Russia). RotaRod test was conducted using UgoBasil hardware with rotation speed increased from 6 to 50 rpm in 3 min, 5 trials were performed with each mouse [22] . On the evening of the same day, animals were placed into cages of Phenomaster (TSE Instruments, Germany), an automated data collection system, where they were monitored for 7 days. The system was equipped with an infrared grid to register animal activity, scales for the water bottle and feeder, a running wheel with unrestricted access and rotation counter, an “operant wall” for positively reinforced operant conditioning [23] . There were 16 such cages, housing mice individually. Measures were read once per minute using TSE software. Blood pressure and heart rate in mice, instrumented with telemetry probes were continuously recorded throughout the tests. Operant conditioning sessions were conducted automatically, once a day and started at 22:30, controlled by IntelliMaze software control. The first session was designed to reinforce nosepokes emitted by an animal while both light stimuli (left and right) were active. This session was used to establish individual baseline tendencies to display nosepokes to the right or left. On subsequent days, mice were trained to direct nosepokes to the side opposite to their initial bias. The number of rewarded responses was limited to 50; each sweetened dry milk pellet weighed 14 mg. To promote learning, mice were maintained at 90% ad lib body weight. Access to food was provided throughout the day from 07:30 until 19:00–20:00. Reward pellets were the alternative source of food. The quality of blood pressure signal (for the operated mice), probabilities of running wheel use, combined with performance in conditioning task were used as criteria for inclusion into experimental groups. Selected mice were randomly assigned to either flight or ground control or vivarium groups. The groups of mice designated for flight were transported to Cosmodrome Baikonur one week before launch. Transportation was by car and by air in several steps and lasted approximately 24 h. Containers of nontransparent blue plastic 40×60 cm with 4 sub-compartments (each for a group of three mice) equipped with air filters (Animal Breeding Facility - Branch of Shemyakin & Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry) were used. Paste food was provided to mice during transportation. One-way ANOVA (transportation bodyweight data) followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparisons was performed with transportation bodyweight data. In order the pre/post flight bodyweight data set met the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity intrinsic to the ANOVA model, rank transformation was applied to the entire set of observations [24] prior to two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-hoc comparisons; noteworthy, the results of the test on raw and transformed data were identical. Fisher's exact test (survival), Man-Whitney U-test (home cage food and water consumption, open field test behavioral data) or paired Student's t-test (metabolic chambers data) was performed using GraphPad Prism software (version 6.00 for MacOS, GraphPad Software, USA). ETHICAL STATEMENT: The study was approved by IACUC of MSU Institute of Mitoengineering (Protocol № 35, 1 November, 2012) and of Biomedical Ethics Commission of IBMP (protocol № 319, 4 April, 2013) and conducted in compliance with the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes [13] .

Blaber; Natalya Dvorochkin; Chialing Lee; Joshua S. Alwood; Rukhsana Yousuf; Piero Pianetta; Ruth K. Globus; Brendan P. Burns; Eduardo A. C. Almeida,"Bone is a dynamically remodeled tissue that requires gravity-mediated mechanical stimulation for maintenance of mineral content and structure. Homeostasis in bone occurs through a balance in the activities and signaling of osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes, as well as proliferation and differentiation of their stem cell progenitors. Microgravity and unloading are known to cause osteoclast-mediated bone resorption; however, we hypothesize that osteocytic osteolysis, and cell cycle arrest during osteogenesis may also contribute to bone loss in space. To test this possibility, we exposed 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (n = 8) to microgravity for 15-days on the STS-131 space shuttle mission. Analysis of the pelvis by µCT shows decreases in bone volume fraction (BV/TV) of 6.29%, and bone thickness of 11.91%. TRAP-positive osteoclast-covered trabecular bone surfaces also increased in microgravity by 170% (p = 0.004), indicating osteoclastic bone degeneration. High-resolution X-ray nanoCT studies revealed signs of lacunar osteolysis, including increases in cross-sectional area (+17%, p = 0.022), perimeter (+14%, p = 0.008), and canalicular diameter (+6%, p = 0.037). Expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 1, 3, and 10 in bone, as measured by RT-qPCR, was also up-regulated in microgravity (+12.94, +2.98 and +16.85 fold respectively, p<0.01), with MMP10 localized to osteocytes, and consistent with induction of osteocytic osteolysis. Furthermore, expression of CDKN1a/p21 in bone increased 3.31 fold (p<0.01), and was localized to osteoblasts, possibly inhibiting the cell cycle during tissue regeneration as well as conferring apoptosis resistance to these cells. Finally the apoptosis inducer Trp53 was down-regulated by −1.54 fold (p<0.01), possibly associated with the quiescent survival-promoting function of CDKN1a/p21. In conclusion, our findings identify the pelvic and femoral region of the mouse skeleton as an active site of rapid bone loss in microgravity, and indicate that this loss is not limited to osteoclastic degradation. Therefore, this study offers new evidence for microgravity-induced osteocytic osteolysis, and CDKN1a/p21-mediated osteogenic cell cycle arrest.","TITLE: Microgravity Induces Pelvic Bone Loss through Osteoclastic Activity, Osteocytic Osteolysis, and Osteoblastic Cell Cycle Inhibition by CDKN1a/p21 ABSTRACT: Bone is a dynamically remodeled tissue that requires gravity-mediated mechanical stimulation for maintenance of mineral content and structure. Homeostasis in bone occurs through a balance in the activities and signaling of osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes, as well as proliferation and differentiation of their stem cell progenitors. Microgravity and unloading are known to cause osteoclast-mediated bone resorption; however, we hypothesize that osteocytic osteolysis, and cell cycle arrest during osteogenesis may also contribute to bone loss in space. To test this possibility, we exposed 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (n = 8) to microgravity for 15-days on the STS-131 space shuttle mission. Analysis of the pelvis by µCT shows decreases in bone volume fraction (BV/TV) of 6.29%, and bone thickness of 11.91%. TRAP-positive osteoclast-covered trabecular bone surfaces also increased in microgravity by 170% (p = 0.004), indicating osteoclastic bone degeneration. High-resolution X-ray nanoCT studies revealed signs of lacunar osteolysis, including increases in cross-sectional area (+17%, p = 0.022), perimeter (+14%, p = 0.008), and canalicular diameter (+6%, p = 0.037). Expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 1, 3, and 10 in bone, as measured by RT-qPCR, was also up-regulated in microgravity (+12.94, +2.98 and +16.85 fold respectively, p<0.01), with MMP10 localized to osteocytes, and consistent with induction of osteocytic osteolysis. Furthermore, expression of CDKN1a/p21 in bone increased 3.31 fold (p<0.01), and was localized to osteoblasts, possibly inhibiting the cell cycle during tissue regeneration as well as conferring apoptosis resistance to these cells. Finally the apoptosis inducer Trp53 was down-regulated by −1.54 fold (p<0.01), possibly associated with the quiescent survival-promoting function of CDKN1a/p21. In conclusion, our findings identify the pelvic and femoral region of the mouse skeleton as an active site of rapid bone loss in microgravity, and indicate that this loss is not limited to osteoclastic degradation. Therefore, this study offers new evidence for microgravity-induced osteocytic osteolysis, and CDKN1a/p21-mediated osteogenic cell cycle arrest. INTRODUCTION: On Earth, at 1 g, mechanical loading of mammalian tissues is an important factor in maintaining tissue health and promoting normal regenerative growth. Forces generated by gravity such as hydrostatic pressure, stretch, and fluid shear are well known to promote normal tissue growth and repair mechanisms. Conversely, during spaceflight, gravity-generated forces are absent and the mechanical stimulation of tissues is greatly diminished. Direct and immediate physiological responses to microgravity-induced mechanical unloading include adaptive losses of bone [1] , [2] , [3] , [4] , [5] , [6] and muscle mass [7] , [8] , [9] , [10] , and alterations in cardiovascular function [11] , [12] , [13] , [14] . Because of practical reasons, most space biological animal research has focused on the short-term effects of spaceflight, and thus our understanding of long-term effects of microgravity exposure is very limited. However, it is likely that over long periods of time mechanical unloading in microgravity may continue to affect tissue regenerative growth and repair, resulting in more widespread degenerative effects. Alternatively, it is also possible that cells and tissues may adapt to microgravity and reach a new homeostatic level appropriate for health maintenance under reduced mechanical load conditions. Since normal tissue repair and regeneration is dependent on the ability of adult stem cells to proliferate and differentiate, we have hypothesized that during long-term spaceflight, the reduction in gravity mechano-stimulation may decrease regenerative proliferation and differentiation of tissue-specific adult stem cells. This in turn may have significant health consequences for multiple tissues throughout the body, including bone. Specifically for bone tissue, short-duration exposure to microgravity rapidly leads to alterations in bone mineral content, cellular dynamics, and gene expression patterns [15] , [16] , [17] , [18] , [19] . This is illustrated by a 1–2% loss of skeletal mineral in weight-bearing bones per month [17] , which poses significant risks for long-duration and interplanetary missions. Because bone remodeling homeostasis depends on tightly coupled mineral deposition and resorption [20] , [21] , uncoupling of these processes in microgravity can cause increased and rapid bone resorption by osteoclasts, and decreased bone formation by osteoblasts [17] , [18] , [22] , [23] . Increased osteoclast bone resorptive activity has been documented within the first several days of spaceflight [1] , [17] and may be reduced after a period of transition and adaptation to microgravity. However, of potentially more importance to long duration missions in microgravity is the reported reduction of bone formation by osteoblasts in growing rats [24] , [25] , [26] , although, this result has not been reproduced. In skeletally mature animals, this bone formation arrest may translate into an impairment of regenerative mechanisms, and therefore may be an important long-term factor in spaceflight. Short of conducting long-term experiments with rodents in space, analysis of the early cell cycle arrest signaling pathways in osteogenic bone cells after short-term spaceflight is the most practical current approach to predict the long-term degenerative effects of microgravity. To perform this analysis we focused on the activation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis pathways such as those mediated by the tumor and growth suppressor, p53, and the cell cycle inhibitor, CDKN1a/p21. P53 levels are reported to increase in the muscle of hindlimb-unloaded animals [27] , potentially leading to cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. Furthermore, p53 knockout mice have preserved trabecular bone volume following hindlimb-unloading [28] and generally, osteopetrotic bone, suggesting a role for the p53-signaling pathway in the regulation of bone formation and degradation [29] , [30] . More remarkably, the CDKN1a/p21 knockout mouse has a viable phenotype with strong tissue regenerative abilities, such as limb re-growth, otherwise unheard of in adult mammals [31] . CDKN1a/p21 can be activated by environmental conditions such as oxidative stress and radiation, or be part of normal cell cycle arrest mechanisms during cell differentiation. This phenotype suggests CDKN1a/p21 up-regulation in microgravity could explain broad regenerative deficits in space. Recent studies have highlighted the potential role of osteocytes, terminally differentiated osteoblasts embedded within the mineralized matrix, in the bone remodeling process, including in osteolysis of the lacunar surface for maintenance of calcium homeostasis [32] , [33] . Results from light and electron microscopy of rat bone in a 22-day spaceflight experiment conducted in 1977 indicated the appearance of lacunae changed to a “wide” morphology that could contribute to bone loss in space [34] . Recently, it was found that osteocytes acquired a more rounded shape after 91-days in microgravity during the Mice Drawer System experiment on ISS, albeit no statistical significance was obtained due to low n, and the authors did not conclude that osteocytic degradation of the lacunae surface was occurring [35] . On the other hand, osteocytic osteolysis was shown to be present in lactating mice but not activated in animals that were hindlimb unloaded for 4 weeks [36] , leaving the potential role and importance of osteocytic osteolysis during spaceflight an open question. To address the limited understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying bone degeneration in space following the initial osteoclastic activation, we focused on the processes related to osteoblastic and osteocytic activities. We hypothesized that decreases in bone formation during spaceflight may be mediated by an inability of cells in osteogenic lineages to proliferate and differentiate normally due to reduced mechanical stimuli in microgravity. Finally, we also hypothesized that reduced mechanostimulation of osteocytes in microgravity may signal the activation of osteocytic osteolysis of lacunar surfaces, with accompanying activation of matrix degradation pathways. Our spaceflight results presented here, suggest that the bone degenerative effects of microgravity in skeletally mature mice go beyond rapid osteoclastic activation, affecting also cell cycle regulation in the osteogenic lineage, and inducing osteocytic osteolysis. RESULTS: All flight and ground control mice were observed to be in good condition by veterinary examination immediately post-landing. Noticeably, the posture of space-flown mouse tails after landing was vertical, indicating increased vestibular function in this group. The average weight loss of space-flown mice was 2.0 g (−9.1%, SD = 2.1 g, p = 0.013) significantly lower than pre-flight values, consistent with tissue atrophy in microgravity, while synchronous ground control mice only lost an average of 0.7 g (−3.4%, SD = 0.9 g, p = 0.096) of their body weight relative to the beginning of spaceflight. The difference in body weight loss averages for flight versus ground controls was not statistically significant (p = 0.143). Flight habitats showed utilization of resources on average of 10% less food, and 24% less water than synchronous ground controls. However, food and water utilization does not account for actual consumption by mice, because differences may occur in food bar and water losses due to crumbling and spillage in microgravity versus 1 g. To determine if bone loss occurred in microgravity, we examined the bone structure and mineral density of the ischial region of the pelvis using micro-computed tomography (µCT). Specifically, we investigated the region from the caudal apex of the obturator foramen through to the ischial tuberosity ( Fig. 1A ) and found that spaceflight resulted in a 6.23% decrease (p = 0.005) in bone volume fraction (BV/TV) and 11.91% decrease (p = 0.002) in overall bone thickness (Th) ( Table 1 ). No difference was observed in bone mineral density and total bone volumes measured (TV and BV) ( Table 1 ). However, comparison of ischial structural thickness of spaceflight versus ground control animals revealed that bone from flight animals not only had a reduced overall thickness ( Fig. 1F and G ), but also showed changes in ischial shape localized to the surface of the descending ramus of ischium along the posterior margin of the obturator foramen ( Fig. 1B ). Analysis of cross-sectional slices revealed that the flight samples had similar widths at two measured points (b/c ratio of 1.09, Fig. 1D , Table 2 ), and a mean bend angle of 167° (deviating 13° from linear, or less bent), compared to a width ratio of 1.39 in ground control samples and a bend angle of 160° (deviating 20° from linear, or more bent) ( Fig. 1C , Table 2 ), indicating that ischial geometry changes in response to spaceflight. Furthermore, when we analyzed the thickness distribution of ischial cross-sectional slices, we found that flight animals exhibited a higher percentage of slices in the 0.007–0.128 mm range and a lower percentage of slices in the 0.129–0.291 mm range compared to ground controls ( Fig. 1E ). The shift in thickness distribution to the left in flight animals indicates an overall decrease in cross-sectional thickness throughout the ischium. The ischium of the pelvis, shown in orange ( A ), was analyzed using μCT (720 slices = 4.89 mm). The anatomical markers used for μCT analysis were (1) caudal apex of obturator foramen, (2) dorsal-most point of the ventral ramus of ischium, and (3) the ischial tuberosity ( A ) (For full details on anatomical markers see [74] ). The ischial cross-sectional geometry ( B ) was analyzed by length (a), the width at the midpoint (b) and at 1/3 distance from the obturator foramen (c); and the bend angle (d). Flight samples ( D ) exhibited a more open cross-sectional geometry compared to the ground control ( C ), indicating a possible reduction in the pull force applied to the bone. Ground control samples ( F ) also exhibited greater thickness (orange/red) then the flight samples ( G ), indicating a reduction in overall bone thickness in spaceflight samples. Significantly less than ground control, p<0.05. Means are reported ± standard deviation. Significantly less than ground control, p<0.05, # Significantly less than ground control, p<0.01. Means are reported ± standard deviation. In order to study nanoscale aspects of bone loss following spaceflight, we used transmission x-ray microscopy to perform 40 nm resolution nano-computed tomography (nanoCT). No difference was found in bulk density of cortical bone between the flight and ground controls ( Fig. 2G ), however, flight samples exhibited an enlargement in lacunae of 17% in cross sectional area (p = 0.022) and a 14% increase in lacunae perimeter (p = 0.008) when compared to ground controls ( Fig. 2C–D, E ). In addition, lacunar circularity decreased in spaceflight by 9% (p = 0.037) indicating an increase in irregularly-shaped or elongated lacunae ( Fig. 2A–B, F ). We also measured canalicular diameters in a 15 µm perilacunar region and found an increase of 6% in spaceflight samples relative to ground controls (p = 0.037, Fig. 2F ), indicating that the observed lacunar enlargement may extend throughout these networks. Figures 2 A and 2B show X-ray phase contrast images of osteocytes viewed laterally and from the top, respectively and illustrate the flattened shape of osteocytic lacunae. For quantification of lacunar size we used X-Ray absorption images of lateral views of lacunae in ischial cortical bone from ground control ( C ) and spaceflight ( D ) animals (n = 7). We observed a 17% increase in lacunae area and a 14% increase in lacunae perimeter of flight animals compared to ground controls ( E ). We also found a 13% increase in lacunae canalicular diameter and a 9% decrease in lacunae circularity of flight animals compared to ground controls ( F ). However, bulk density analysis showed no statistical difference between flight and ground control animals that is in agreement with µCT analysis ( G ). *indicates p<0.05, #indicates p<0.01. To characterize osteoclast bone resorbing activity during spaceflight, we used TRAP staining on sections of the proximal femur. We found a 197% increase in osteoclast numbers in the bone surface of the trabecular region below the femoral head growth plate of flight samples (9.99 Oc/mm) compared to ground controls (3.36 Oc/mm) (p = 0.001, Fig. 3A–C ). The bone surface covered by osteoclasts also increased by 154% in microgravity (25.4% in spaceflight versus 9.99% in ground controls, p = 0.004 Fig. 3D ). Results for spaceflight induction of all TRAP-positive osteoclasts, independent of number of nuclei, were comparable. Interestingly, we also found an increase in the ratio of TRAP-positive osteocytes to total osteocytes in the femoral shaft of flight samples compared to ground controls (34.43% and 20.94% respectively, p = 0.004, Fig. 3D–G ). To determine if osteocyte survival was altered by microgravity we measured the number of empty lacunae in cortical bone from the proximal femur and found no differences between ground and flight samples (10.6% and 10.0% empty lacunae respectively, p = 0.680, Fig. 3H ). Pyknotic nuclei were occasionally present in tissue surrounding bone, but were non-detectable in osteocytes. These results indicate roles for both osteoclastic and osteocytic bone degradation in microgravity. Panel A displays a representative cancellous region near the femoral head growth plate (40×) from ground control mice, which is mostly free of TRAP-positive osteoclasts, whilst B displays a similar region from flight animals with numerous TRAP-positive osteoclasts. Analysis of osteoclastic activity in the trabecular region below the femoral head of the femur showed an increase in osteoclast numbers in the bone surface of the growth plate of flight samples compared to ground controls (9.99 Oc/mm and 3.36 Oc/mm respectively) ( C ). The bone surface covered by osteoclasts was also increased in flight animals compared to ground controls (25.40% and 9.99% respectively, D ). The number of TRAP-positive osteocytes in cortical bone from the femoral shaft proximal to the femoral head was increased in response to spaceflight ( E ) compared to ground controls ( D ) (34.43% and 20.94% respectively, F ). However, we found no differences in the number of empty lacunae in cortical bone between flight and ground controls (10.6% and 10.0% empty lacunae respectively, H ). * indicates p<0.05, # indicates p<0.01. Among bone extracellular matrix related genes analyzed using RT-qPCR arrays we found small but statistically significant alterations in mRNA levels of collagens, and laminin subunits, but not in fibronectin ( Fig. 4A , Table 3 ). Among matrix metalloproteinases, MMP 1, 3, and 10 showed significant up-regulation in flight samples compared to ground controls (12.94, 2.98, and 16.85 fold respectively, p<0.05), while MMP inhibitors, TIMP 1, 2, and 3, displayed no statistically significant change in gene expression levels ( Table 3 ). Several cell adhesion molecules; specifically Cdh4, Cdh11, and Vcam1 were found to be up-regulated (2.46, 1.53, and 1.57 fold respectively, p<0.05), while Itgal and Icam1 were found to be down-regulated (1.45 and 1.52 fold respectively, p<0.05) ( Fig. 4A , Table 3 ). These results indicate that spaceflight promotes bone extracellular matrix degradation, while overall increase in expression of collagen, Tuft1, Sparc, and Phex ( Table 3 ), may be related to increased bone mineralization following degradation. RT-PCR analysis of ilium revealed significant up-regulation of matrix degradation molecules MMP1a, MMP3, and MMP10 as well as small changes in a number of extracellular matrix molecules in flight samples compared to ground controls ( A ). Immunohistochemical analysis localized over-expression of MMP10 to osteocytes in the shaft of the proximal femur in flight samples ( C ) but not in ground controls ( B ), indicating a role for osteocytes in lacunae degradation. * indicates p<0.05, # indicates p<0.01. To determine the cellular location of MMP10 we conducted immunohistochemical analysis on paraffin embedded sections of the proximal femur. Results showed MMP10-positive staining in osteoblasts along the periosteal surface of the proximal femur in both flight and ground controls. However, osteocytes embedded in the bone matrix exhibited strong MMP10-positive staining in flight samples ( Fig. 4C ) but not in ground ( Fig. 4B ). To further study the effects of spaceflight in reducing bone formation, we investigated the expression of genes involved in promoting the cellular growth, proliferation, and differentiation of the osteoprogenitor lineage. A number of growth factors studied showed altered gene expression levels by qPCR, including Bmp-4, Tgf-β2, Gdf10, and Csf3 (−1.99, −1.59, −1.43, 3.72 fold, p<0.05) ( Fig. 5A , Table 3 ). Furthermore, we found several genes associated with cell growth and differentiation that were altered, including Egr1, Myod1, and Fgf3 which were down-regulated (−2.30, −1.61, and −1.7 fold respectively, p<0.05), while Twist1 and Fgf1 were up-regulated (1.80 and 1.53 fold respectively, p<0.01) ( Fig. 5A , Table 3 ). Results also indicate the alteration in gene expression of two transcription factors, Vitamin D receptor (Vdr) and Sox9, which exhibited a 2.80 fold up-regulation and 2.28 fold down-regulation respectively ( Fig. 5A , Table 3 ). RT-PCR analysis of revealed altered expression levels of key genes involved in osteogenic growth and proliferation including growth factors, Bmp4 and Tgfβ2, and transcription factors Vdr and Sox9 (A). Analysis of key mitogenic signal transduction pathways revealed alterations in gene expression of the MAPK pathway, whilst Pi3K and Akt signaling molecules were not changed statistically. We also observed significant up-regulation of the NFκB inhibitor, NFκBIa/IκBα (B). In addition to the effects we observed on osteogenesis promoting gene expression, we hypothesized that bone loss in space may also be mediated by alterations in intracellular signaling cascades resulting in activation of the p53/p21 signaling pathways that promote cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Analysis of spaceflight samples by qPCR showed that mRNA expression levels of tumor suppressor gene p53 (Trp/p53) were down-regulated 1.54 fold while CDKN1a/p21 exhibited a 3.31 fold up-regulation in response to exposure to spaceflight (p<0.01) ( Fig. 6G ). The expression of Mdm2, a negative regulator of p53, was also increased, indicating suppression of the p53 apoptotic pathway ( Fig. 6G , Table 3 ). Several genes associated with cell cycle regulation were also altered in flight samples including cell cycle arrest related genes Fbxo4, Fbxo31, Btg2, and Cdkn2b (1.87, 1.74, −1.50, and 1.41 fold respectively, p<0.05), and cell cycle related genes cyclin B2, Cdc25c, Mul1, Gdf10, and Csf3 (1.63, 1.55, 1.64, −1.43 and 3.72 fold respectively, p<0.05) ( Fig. 6G , Table 3 ). Several genes related to the induction of apoptosis were also altered including, Cradd, Dapk1, Fbxo3, which were up-regulated in flight samples (1.62, 1.53, and 1.48 fold respectively, p<0.01) ( Fig. 6G ). Hecw2, which acts to stabilize p73, was also up-regulated in flight samples (2.25, p<0.01), as was p73, albeit not statistically significantly (2.02 fold, p = 0.20) ( Table 3 ). RT-PCR analysis revealed significant alterations in many cell cycle molecules including a 3.31 fold up-regulation of p21 and down-regulation of p53 ( G ). Immunohistochemical analysis localized this overexpression of p21 to osteoblasts along the periosteal surface of the proximal femur ( A , ground control, B , flight). Interestingly, we also observed p21-positive nuclei in cross-sections and longitudinal sections of muscle fibers adjacent to the femur ( C–D , ground control, E–F , flight). *indicates p<0.05, # indicates p<0.01. In order to determine the specific cellular localization of the p21 and p53 proteins, we conducted immunohistochemical analysis on sections of the right proximal femur of both flight animals and synchronous ground controls. Using a rabbit anti-mouse p21 polyclonal antibody, we found that osteoblasts along the periosteal surface of the proximal femur were p21-positive in flight samples but not in synchronous ground controls (n = 6, Fig. 6A–B ). Muscle fibers surrounding the femur contained strongly positive p21 staining nuclei in spaceflight but not ground control samples ( Fig. 6C–F ). When we investigated the expression of p53 in proximal sections of the femur using a p53 polyclonal antibody, no significant staining was found in most sections from both flight and ground controls’, indicating that p53 was not strongly expressed. As cell signaling promoting cell survival via phosphoinositide 3-kinase (Pi3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) and cell proliferation via Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAP kinase) can both be activated in response to mechano-transduction, and as they can modulate p53 and p21 signaling, we investigated key genes of interest in these pathways with qPCR. MAP kinases, such as MAPK10, MAPK11, and MAPK12 (3.81, −1.54, and −1.43 fold respectively, p<0.01), MAP 3 kinases, such as Moloney sarcoma oncogene, Mos (−4.18 fold, p<0.01), and cell growth molecules including Egr1 (−2.30 fold, p<0.01) showed altered expression in spaceflight ( Fig. 5 , Table 3 ). Several molecules associated with Ras signaling displayed alterations, including Nf1 (−1.45 fold, p<0.05) and Sos1 (−2.51 fold, p<0.01); however, only small changes in KRas expression was found (−1.24 fold, p<0.05) ( Fig. 5B , Table 3 ). No statistically significant alterations in Pi3K subunits were noted except a small change in the alpha polypeptide of the catalytic subunit of Pi3K (−1.39 fold, p<0.01) ( Table 3 ). Additionally, no statistically significant alterations in Akt1 or 2 were found, however, a small change in Akt3/PKB was observed (−1.32 fold, p<0.01) ( Fig. 5B , Table 3 ). After exposure to microgravity, the NF-κB inhibitor, IκBα, exhibited a significant increase in expression (2.03 fold, p<0.01) and NF-κB mRNA exhibited a slight decrease in expression (−1.27 fold, p<0.05) ( Fig. 5B , Table 3 ). Several downstream effectors of these signaling pathways were also altered in response to spaceflight, including Rps6kb1, a down-stream effector of the Pi3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, and Eif4ebp1, a repressor of translation (−2.05 and 1.55 fold respectively, p<0.05). Eif4e, which is activated by Rps6kb1 and inactivated by Eif4bp1, was also down-regulated slightly by spaceflight (−1.40, p<0.05) ( Fig. 5B , Table 3 ). Transcription factors and transcriptional targets associated with these pathways were also investigated and it was found that activated transcription factors c-Fos and Nfatc4 (−2.37 and −1.98 fold respectively, p<0.05) were altered in response to spaceflight. Analysis of NFκB transcriptional target genes involved in cell adhesion, regulation of apoptosis and growth factors and ligands including Traf1, BMP4, Egr1, p53, and MMP3 (repressor) were found to be down-regulated, indicating inhibition of this pathway after exposure to spaceflight ( Fig. 5B , Table 3 ). BODY MASS OF ANIMALS PRE- AND POST-FLIGHT: All flight and ground control mice were observed to be in good condition by veterinary examination immediately post-landing. Noticeably, the posture of space-flown mouse tails after landing was vertical, indicating increased vestibular function in this group. The average weight loss of space-flown mice was 2.0 g (−9.1%, SD = 2.1 g, p = 0.013) significantly lower than pre-flight values, consistent with tissue atrophy in microgravity, while synchronous ground control mice only lost an average of 0.7 g (−3.4%, SD = 0.9 g, p = 0.096) of their body weight relative to the beginning of spaceflight. The difference in body weight loss averages for flight versus ground controls was not statistically significant (p = 0.143). Flight habitats showed utilization of resources on average of 10% less food, and 24% less water than synchronous ground controls. However, food and water utilization does not account for actual consumption by mice, because differences may occur in food bar and water losses due to crumbling and spillage in microgravity versus 1 g. SPACEFLIGHT CAUSES OSTEOCLAST AND OSTEOCYTE-MEDIATED BONE LOSS IN THE PELVIC REGION OF MICE: To determine if bone loss occurred in microgravity, we examined the bone structure and mineral density of the ischial region of the pelvis using micro-computed tomography (µCT). Specifically, we investigated the region from the caudal apex of the obturator foramen through to the ischial tuberosity ( Fig. 1A ) and found that spaceflight resulted in a 6.23% decrease (p = 0.005) in bone volume fraction (BV/TV) and 11.91% decrease (p = 0.002) in overall bone thickness (Th) ( Table 1 ). No difference was observed in bone mineral density and total bone volumes measured (TV and BV) ( Table 1 ). However, comparison of ischial structural thickness of spaceflight versus ground control animals revealed that bone from flight animals not only had a reduced overall thickness ( Fig. 1F and G ), but also showed changes in ischial shape localized to the surface of the descending ramus of ischium along the posterior margin of the obturator foramen ( Fig. 1B ). Analysis of cross-sectional slices revealed that the flight samples had similar widths at two measured points (b/c ratio of 1.09, Fig. 1D , Table 2 ), and a mean bend angle of 167° (deviating 13° from linear, or less bent), compared to a width ratio of 1.39 in ground control samples and a bend angle of 160° (deviating 20° from linear, or more bent) ( Fig. 1C , Table 2 ), indicating that ischial geometry changes in response to spaceflight. Furthermore, when we analyzed the thickness distribution of ischial cross-sectional slices, we found that flight animals exhibited a higher percentage of slices in the 0.007–0.128 mm range and a lower percentage of slices in the 0.129–0.291 mm range compared to ground controls ( Fig. 1E ). The shift in thickness distribution to the left in flight animals indicates an overall decrease in cross-sectional thickness throughout the ischium. The ischium of the pelvis, shown in orange ( A ), was analyzed using μCT (720 slices = 4.89 mm). The anatomical markers used for μCT analysis were (1) caudal apex of obturator foramen, (2) dorsal-most point of the ventral ramus of ischium, and (3) the ischial tuberosity ( A ) (For full details on anatomical markers see [74] ). The ischial cross-sectional geometry ( B ) was analyzed by length (a), the width at the midpoint (b) and at 1/3 distance from the obturator foramen (c); and the bend angle (d). Flight samples ( D ) exhibited a more open cross-sectional geometry compared to the ground control ( C ), indicating a possible reduction in the pull force applied to the bone. Ground control samples ( F ) also exhibited greater thickness (orange/red) then the flight samples ( G ), indicating a reduction in overall bone thickness in spaceflight samples. Significantly less than ground control, p<0.05. Means are reported ± standard deviation. Significantly less than ground control, p<0.05, # Significantly less than ground control, p<0.01. Means are reported ± standard deviation. In order to study nanoscale aspects of bone loss following spaceflight, we used transmission x-ray microscopy to perform 40 nm resolution nano-computed tomography (nanoCT). No difference was found in bulk density of cortical bone between the flight and ground controls ( Fig. 2G ), however, flight samples exhibited an enlargement in lacunae of 17% in cross sectional area (p = 0.022) and a 14% increase in lacunae perimeter (p = 0.008) when compared to ground controls ( Fig. 2C–D, E ). In addition, lacunar circularity decreased in spaceflight by 9% (p = 0.037) indicating an increase in irregularly-shaped or elongated lacunae ( Fig. 2A–B, F ). We also measured canalicular diameters in a 15 µm perilacunar region and found an increase of 6% in spaceflight samples relative to ground controls (p = 0.037, Fig. 2F ), indicating that the observed lacunar enlargement may extend throughout these networks. Figures 2 A and 2B show X-ray phase contrast images of osteocytes viewed laterally and from the top, respectively and illustrate the flattened shape of osteocytic lacunae. For quantification of lacunar size we used X-Ray absorption images of lateral views of lacunae in ischial cortical bone from ground control ( C ) and spaceflight ( D ) animals (n = 7). We observed a 17% increase in lacunae area and a 14% increase in lacunae perimeter of flight animals compared to ground controls ( E ). We also found a 13% increase in lacunae canalicular diameter and a 9% decrease in lacunae circularity of flight animals compared to ground controls ( F ). However, bulk density analysis showed no statistical difference between flight and ground control animals that is in agreement with µCT analysis ( G ). *indicates p<0.05, #indicates p<0.01. To characterize osteoclast bone resorbing activity during spaceflight, we used TRAP staining on sections of the proximal femur. We found a 197% increase in osteoclast numbers in the bone surface of the trabecular region below the femoral head growth plate of flight samples (9.99 Oc/mm) compared to ground controls (3.36 Oc/mm) (p = 0.001, Fig. 3A–C ). The bone surface covered by osteoclasts also increased by 154% in microgravity (25.4% in spaceflight versus 9.99% in ground controls, p = 0.004 Fig. 3D ). Results for spaceflight induction of all TRAP-positive osteoclasts, independent of number of nuclei, were comparable. Interestingly, we also found an increase in the ratio of TRAP-positive osteocytes to total osteocytes in the femoral shaft of flight samples compared to ground controls (34.43% and 20.94% respectively, p = 0.004, Fig. 3D–G ). To determine if osteocyte survival was altered by microgravity we measured the number of empty lacunae in cortical bone from the proximal femur and found no differences between ground and flight samples (10.6% and 10.0% empty lacunae respectively, p = 0.680, Fig. 3H ).

INTRODUCTION: Microgravity, a condition characterized by minimal and almost imperceptible gravitational forces, occurs primarily in space or in specialized environments designed to simulate this state [ 1 , 2 ]. In cellular biology, microgravity presents a unique opportunity to study how cells respond to the drastic reduction in gravity—a fundamental factor that regulates numerous cellular processes on Earth [ 3 , 4 , 5 ]. Under microgravity conditions, mechanical forces that influence cell structure and function undergo significant alterations, impacting cytoskeletal organization, cell adhesion, and intracellular signaling. These changes in turn affect critical cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, communication, and survival [ 4 , 5 , 6 ]. Historically, research on microgravity has been conducted aboard space stations, such as the International Space Station, and on suborbital platforms. More recently, terrestrial laboratories have adopted advanced technologies, such as rotating bioreactors, to simulate microgravity conditions [ 1 , 7 , 8 ]. These investigations, conducted both in space and on Earth, have gained importance due to their dual applications: safeguarding astronaut health and addressing terrestrial diseases [ 1 , 9 , 10 ]. This review aims to explore recent advances in understanding the effects of microgravity on biological processes, emphasizing its implications and applications for human health. 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases. Search terms were structured following the PICOT framework, with the components defined as follows: Population: Stem cells, T cells, endothelial cells, cancer cells, kidney cells, and bone cells. Intervention: Microgravity, simulated microgravity, or microgravity conditions. Comparison: Cells under normal or standard gravity conditions. Outcomes: Effects on cell proliferation, tissue regeneration, cellular metabolism, organ homeostasis, and immune health. Timing: Publications with no start date restriction, available up to November 2024. Population: Stem cells, T cells, endothelial cells, cancer cells, kidney cells, and bone cells. Intervention: Microgravity, simulated microgravity, or microgravity conditions. Comparison: Cells under normal or standard gravity conditions. Outcomes: Effects on cell proliferation, tissue regeneration, cellular metabolism, organ homeostasis, and immune health. Timing: Publications with no start date restriction, available up to November 2024. The research question, based on the PICO framework, was as follows: “How does microgravity (including simulated conditions) affect stem cells, T cells, endothelial cells, kidney cells, and other biological cells compared to cells under normal gravity conditions, specifically in terms of cell proliferation, tissue regeneration, cellular metabolism, organ homeostasis, and immune health?” To ensure a comprehensive search, relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms were included. Key terms covered the study populations (e.g., stem cells, T cells, endothelial cells, cancer cells, kidney cells, bone cells), conditions (e.g., microgravity, simulated microgravity, standard gravity), and outcomes of interest (e.g., cell proliferation, tissue regeneration, cellular metabolism, organ homeostasis, immune health). The literature search was performed in December 2024 and included publications in English and Spanish. Eligible studies encompassed observational studies, in vitro research, and experimental investigations that addressed the effects of microgravity on critical biological processes. The retrieved results were systematically categorized based on their focus, enabling a detailed analysis of microgravity’s impact on different biological functions. The findings were then contrasted with observations from cells maintained under standard gravity conditions, providing a comprehensive comparison of cellular adaptations in these environments. 3. EFFECTS OF MICROGRAVITY ON THE IMMUNE SYSTEM: Microgravity significantly impacts the immune system, compromising the development, function, and response of immune cells, which weakens the body’s defenses in space environments. Hematopoietic stem cells, essential for generating immune cells, show impaired differentiation into macrophages, critical for infection control. Furthermore, an imbalance between M1 (pro-inflammatory) and M2 (anti-inflammatory and repair) macrophages disrupts the immune system’s ability to handle infections and repair tissues [ 1 , 2 ]. Dendritic cells, pivotal in T lymphocyte activation via antigen presentation, are also adversely affected. Key molecules such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and costimulatory proteins CD80 and CD86 show reduced expression, diminishing dendritic cell functionality. Notably, brief exposures to microgravity transiently enhance dendritic cell activity; however, this effect is not sustained over the long term [ 2 ]. Neutrophils exhibit increased numbers in microgravity but with reduced functionality, impairing their ability to destroy microorganisms effectively. B lymphocytes, responsible for humoral immunity, demonstrate decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis. Similarly, natural killer (NK) cells, critical for innate immunity, experience reduced cytotoxic activity, limiting their ability to eliminate tumors or infected cells [ 2 , 3 ] ( Figure 1 ). Microgravity profoundly affects T cell-mediated immunity, disrupting activation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Studies using concanavalin A—a standard activator of resting T cells—revealed significant inhibition of activation and proliferation in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with the effects intensifying over longer exposure durations. Reduced expression of activation markers such as CD25 (IL-2 receptor), CD69 (early activation marker), and CD71 (iron transport marker) underscores this dysfunction [ 11 , 12 ]. CD4+ T cells, critical for regulating immune responses through cytokines like IL-2 and IFN-γ, show a greater reduction in proliferation and cytokine production compared to CD8+ T cells. Even brief exposure (8 h) to microgravity notably suppresses CD4+ cell functions, while CD8+ cells require longer exposure (16 h) to exhibit similar impairments [ 11 , 12 ]. Cytokine production is notably compromised under microgravity. CD4+ cells exhibit decreased secretion of IL-2, essential for T cell expansion, and IFN-γ, crucial for macrophage activation and antiviral defense. These deficiencies indicate a reduced capacity of T cells to coordinate and amplify immune responses [ 11 ]. Apoptosis of T cells is accelerated under microgravity, with an earlier onset of late apoptotic processes. Pre-exposed cells show an increase in late-stage apoptosis and a reduction in early-stage apoptosis, indicating a faster progression through apoptotic pathways compared to controls under normal gravity. This effect is linked to increased expression of the Fas receptor in CD8+ cells, a critical component of the Fas/FasL pathway, which regulates apoptosis through external signals [ 12 , 13 , 14 ] ( Figure 1 ). At the molecular level, microgravity disrupts critical signaling pathways, including RAS, ERK, and NF-κB. The RAS pathway, which governs cell proliferation and survival, shows reduced activity under microgravity, leading to impaired cell growth. Similarly, ERK, which is essential for cell differentiation and responses to external stimuli, undergoes alterations that hinder the activation and specialization of macrophages and lymphocytes. NF-κB, a key regulator of inflammatory responses, exhibits inconsistent activation in microgravity, resulting in inadequate immune responses [ 1 , 4 ]. Research on microgravity has also revealed significant effects on cancer biology, including the formation of multicellular spheroids (MCS), the reorganization of the cytoskeleton, and the regulation of key proteins such as p53 (a tumor suppressor), NF-κB (a regulator of immune responses and inflammation), and BAX (a pro-apoptotic protein involved in programmed cell death). These processes promote apoptosis in various cancer cell types. In cell lines from breast (MCF-7), thyroid (FTC-133), and lung (A549) cancers, microgravity-induced changes include decreased cell adhesion and altered gene expression, particularly in molecules like E-cadherin (important for cell adhesion and tumor invasion suppression), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, which promotes angiogenesis), and vimentin (a protein associated with epithelial–mesenchymal transition and cell migration), thereby affecting tumor proliferation and dissemination [ 15 , 16 ]. 3.1. ALTERATIONS IN IMMUNE CELLS: Microgravity significantly impacts the immune system, compromising the development, function, and response of immune cells, which weakens the body’s defenses in space environments. Hematopoietic stem cells, essential for generating immune cells, show impaired differentiation into macrophages, critical for infection control. Furthermore, an imbalance between M1 (pro-inflammatory) and M2 (anti-inflammatory and repair) macrophages disrupts the immune system’s ability to handle infections and repair tissues [ 1 , 2 ].

B lymphocytes, responsible for humoral immunity, demonstrate decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis. Similarly, natural killer (NK) cells, critical for innate immunity, experience reduced cytotoxic activity, limiting their ability to eliminate tumors or infected cells [ 2 , 3 ] ( Figure 1 ). 3.2. IMPACT ON T CELLS: Microgravity profoundly affects T cell-mediated immunity, disrupting activation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Studies using concanavalin A—a standard activator of resting T cells—revealed significant inhibition of activation and proliferation in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with the effects intensifying over longer exposure durations. Reduced expression of activation markers such as CD25 (IL-2 receptor), CD69 (early activation marker), and CD71 (iron transport marker) underscores this dysfunction [ 11 , 12 ].

This effect is linked to increased expression of the Fas receptor in CD8+ cells, a critical component of the Fas/FasL pathway, which regulates apoptosis through external signals [ 12 , 13 , 14 ] ( Figure 1 ). 3.3. IMPACT ON KEY MOLECULAR PATHWAYS: At the molecular level, microgravity disrupts critical signaling pathways, including RAS, ERK, and NF-κB. The RAS pathway, which governs cell proliferation and survival, shows reduced activity under microgravity, leading to impaired cell growth. Similarly, ERK, which is essential for cell differentiation and responses to external stimuli, undergoes alterations that hinder the activation and specialization of macrophages and lymphocytes. NF-κB, a key regulator of inflammatory responses, exhibits inconsistent activation in microgravity, resulting in inadequate immune responses [ 1 , 4 ].

IMPACT ON CANCER BIOLOGY: The study of cancer stem cells (CSCs) under simulated microgravity conditions provides critical insights into their behavior in extreme environments, with profound implications for oncology and regenerative medicine. CSCs, characterized by their self-renewal and differentiation capabilities, contribute to tumor heterogeneity, treatment resistance, and metastasis [ 5 , 6 ]. In cancers such as breast, lung, and gastrointestinal cancer, CSCs are identified using specific markers, enabling their isolation and detailed analysis. Under simulated microgravity, these cells exhibit significant changes in morphology and growth patterns, including the formation of multicellular spheroids. These three-dimensional structures closely mimic in vivo tumor organization, offering a robust model for studying the effects of microgravity on tumor biology [ 5 , 7 , 8 ]. Exposure to microgravity induces notable cellular changes, including increased apoptosis and decreased expression of pluripotency-related markers, suggesting a shift toward differentiation. This differentiation reduces CSC resistance, potentially enhancing their susceptibility to treatments. In gastrointestinal cancers like colon and pancreatic cancer, simulated microgravity has been linked to increased expression of specific markers, reflecting alterations in the regulatory mechanisms of cell growth and differentiation. These changes can significantly influence tumor progression and the efficacy of oncological treatments [ 6 , 7 , 8 ] ( Figure 2 ). Microgravity modulates apoptosis, a key defense against abnormal cell proliferation. Many cancer cells under microgravity show increased apoptosis due to altered mechanical forces, while some acquire stem-like properties, enhancing resistance, plasticity, and therapy resistance [ 17 , 18 ]. Microgravity also induces the formation of multicellular spheroids (MCS), which mimic solid tumors and exhibit increased resistance to chemotherapy and radiation, suggesting more aggressive cancer states. Additionally, reduced gravity downregulates adhesion proteins (e.g., E-cadherin, vinculin, paxillin), weakening cell–cell interactions and potentially enhancing metastatic potential. The combination of microgravity and ionizing radiation exacerbates DNA damage, genomic instability, and mutations in tumor cells, highlighting the need for protective measures during space missions and offering insights into cancer treatment [ 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 ]. Simulated microgravity, using devices like the rotating wall bioreactor (RWV) and random positioning machine (RPM), replicates certain effects of real microgravity (r-µg) but with some differences. High-energy radiation with high linear energy transfer (high LET) increases genomic instability and mutation risks, promoting apoptosis and chromosomal aberrations [ 23 , 24 ]. In gliomas (U251 model), microgravity reduces the activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), RhoA, and Nek2 kinase, inhibiting tumor cell migration. Immune cells, such as T lymphocytes and macrophages, show decreased functionality, compromising immunosurveillance and hindering cancer detection [ 25 , 26 , 27 ]. Recent findings suggest that microgravity could offer therapeutic benefits by inhibiting NF-κB, reducing cancer spread, and decreasing VEGF activity to limit tumor growth through reduced angiogenesis. Changes in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway may slow tumor growth and metastasis. CSCs, typically resistant to therapies, become more vulnerable under microgravity, which also alters extracellular vesicle (EV) protein and microRNA content, opening opportunities for new biomarkers and targeted therapies [ 28 ]. The mechanosensitive channel ELKIN1 plays a crucial role in cellular responses to microgravity. Microgravity reduces tumor cell adhesion and invasion, offering potential therapeutic benefits, but these effects are ELKIN1-dependent. Its absence preserves cell structure and adhesion stability in microgravity, protecting healthy cells during prolonged exposure, but may enhance the persistence of cancer cells, limiting therapy effectiveness [ 29 ]. At the molecular level, microgravity reduces the nuclear localization of the transcriptional regulator YAP1, limiting excessive cell proliferation and invasiveness. This effect depends on ELKIN1 expression; its absence could lead to resistance or diminished responsiveness to mechanical stimuli. ELKIN1-mediated reduction in focal adhesion proteins may limit tumor aggressiveness but could pose a structural disadvantage for healthy tissues during extended space missions [ 29 ]. Microgravity, whether experienced in space or simulated on Earth, provides a unique experimental environment that has greatly advanced our understanding of cancer biology, particularly thyroid cancer [ 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 ]. For nearly two decades, studies on thyroid cancer cells under microgravity have yielded valuable insights into tumor behavior that are difficult to achieve under conventional laboratory conditions. In microgravity, adherent thyroid cancer cells lose their adhesion properties and organize into multicellular spheroids. These structures closely resemble the physiological characteristics of tumors in vivo, making them ideal models for studying metastasis and evaluating novel targeted therapies [ 30 , 31 ]. Microgravity also affects fundamental cellular processes, including apoptosis, cytoskeletal organization, and extracellular matrix dynamics, which are critical for cell growth and proliferation. Notably, follicular thyroid cancer cells exposed to microgravity have demonstrated a tendency to adopt a less malignant phenotype. This suggests that microgravity conditions may induce favorable changes, potentially aiding in the treatment of thyroid cancer [ 30 , 31 ]. The findings from these studies have the potential to revolutionize traditional oncology research approaches. They facilitate the identification of key cellular alterations in cancer pathogenesis and support the development of innovative therapies aimed at improving patient outcomes. Furthermore, these investigations pave the way for novel preventive strategies and more effective treatments based on the unique cellular properties observed under microgravity [ 30 , 32 ]. 4.1.

THYROID CANCER: Microgravity, whether experienced in space or simulated on Earth, provides a unique experimental environment that has greatly advanced our understanding of cancer biology, particularly thyroid cancer [ 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 ]. For nearly two decades, studies on thyroid cancer cells under microgravity have yielded valuable insights into tumor behavior that are difficult to achieve under conventional laboratory conditions.

Furthermore, these investigations pave the way for novel preventive strategies and more effective treatments based on the unique cellular properties observed under microgravity [ 30 , 32 ]. 5. IMPACTS ON TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS: Simulated microgravity profoundly affects microvascular endothelial cells, which play a pivotal role in vascular homeostasis by regulating inflammation, angiogenesis, and vascular permeability [ 9 , 10 ]. Under normal gravity, endothelial cells respond to mechanical and chemical stimuli to preserve vascular function. However, under simulated microgravity, significant alterations are observed. One prominent effect is the inhibition of cell proliferation, which delays the repair of damaged blood vessels. Reduced production of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine crucial for the inflammatory response, further compromises immune functionality and vascular repair capacity [ 9 , 23 ]. Interestingly, microgravity stimulates the synthesis of nitric oxide, a critical mediator for blood vessel dilation and angiogenesis. This effect is linked to the activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). While nitric oxide promotes vascular adaptation, its dysregulation can lead to pathological states, depending on the physiological context [ 9 , 23 ]. Research on simulated microgravity has also revealed significant effects on endothelial cell integrity and function. In one study, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, essential regulators of cardiovascular homeostasis, were exposed to simulated microgravity for up to 72 h using an RPM, which continuously rotates to nullify Earth’s gravitational vector [ 24 ]. After 24 h, notable changes in cellular biomechanical properties were observed, including a marked reduction in cell stiffness (Young’s modulus) and viscosity. Specifically, cellular elasticity decreased by approximately 30%, reaching critical levels with a 75% reduction after 72 h. This loss of rigidity makes endothelial cells more vulnerable to external hemodynamic stress, potentially impairing vascular integrity and increasing the risk of endothelial dysfunction [ 23 , 24 ]. Additionally, endothelial cells exhibited morphological changes under simulated microgravity conditions. Normally elongated and spindle-shaped, cells adopted a distinctly rounded phenotype after 24 h. The increase in circularity—more than three times greater than that of control cells—indicates significant cytoskeletal reorganization, which could affect vascular permeability and the cells’ ability to respond to mechanical stress over time [ 23 , 34 ]. At the molecular level, these morphological alterations were associated with substantial reductions in key cytoskeletal components. Western blot analysis revealed a 65% reduction in actin filament levels and a 26% reduction in β-tubulin, a protein critical for microtubule integrity. Immunofluorescence confirmed these findings, showing discontinuities in cortical actin filaments and abnormal redistribution of microtubules, particularly around the nucleus. These results highlight impaired structural integrity and suggest that endothelial cells may have a compromised ability to respond to biomechanical stimuli [ 23 , 34 ] ( Figure 3 ). Endothelial cells exposed to microgravity also form three-dimensional spheroids, which closely mimic in vivo blood vessel structures. These 3D models are invaluable for studying microgravity-induced changes in endothelial function, enabling more physiologically relevant investigations compared to traditional 2D cultures [ 9 , 10 , 23 ]. Collectively, these findings reveal that microgravity disrupts endothelial physiology, influencing cell proliferation, inflammatory responses, and vascular regulation. These insights have implications for diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis, and other circulatory disorders. They underscore the need for further research to mitigate vascular risks during space missions and explore potential therapeutic applications on Earth [ 9 ]. Microgravity, a defining feature of spaceflight and terrestrial simulations, profoundly impacts the metabolism and functionality of various organs, particularly the liver. Experimental models using rhesus macaques have shown that prolonged exposure to microgravity induces significant metabolic alterations similar to those observed in rodents. These include lipid accumulation and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the liver, reflecting the disruption of hepatic metabolic homeostasis. Such findings underscore the importance of exploring the effects of microgravity on metabolic regulation in animal models and future human studies [ 34 , 35 , 36 ] ( Figure 3 ). In a 42-day head-down bed rest model simulating microgravity, rhesus macaques developed mild li",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11988870/
